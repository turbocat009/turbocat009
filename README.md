# 👋 Hi there! I'm Turbocat 🐱
## Your cat dev

### 💻 About Me
I'm a 16-year-old developer who loves experimenting with code and building small, fun projects.  
I enjoy learning new technologies and using programming as a creative outlet — whether it's a web app, a simple game, or just something random I thought would be cool to make.

### 🧠 Tech Stack
Here are some of the languages and tools I’ve worked with:
- 🌐 **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- ⚙️ **Backend / General:** Python, C++, Java, C  

### 🎯 What I Like To Do
- Build small and random projects (sometimes useful, sometimes just for fun)
- Explore new programming languages and frameworks
- Listen to music while coding 🎧

### 🎵 Fun Fact
Music keeps me inspired — there's always a playlist running while I’m coding.
Also, in my free time, I like playing the piano
